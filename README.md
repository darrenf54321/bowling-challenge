Bowling Challenge
=================
This was beyond my ability at this stage in the course - at least with the time allocated. I decided to stop at the passing tests and basic game set-up.
I haver shamelessly copied the html and css document from the Internet and slightly customised it. I cannot take credit for these two files, as they do not constitute my own work. I propose changing these in the future when the project is revisited.
